# User

For this assignment you will create the user class and add a couple methods!

Attributes:
On instantiation of a user, the following attributes should be passed in as arguments:

first_name
last_name
email
age
Also include default attributes:

is_rewards_member - default value of False
gold_card_points = 0
Methods:
display_info(self) - Have this method print all of the users' details on separate lines.
enroll(self) - Have this method change the user's member status to True and set their gold card points to 200.
spend_points(self, amount) - have this method decrease the user's points by the amount specified.
Ninja Bonuses:

Add logic in the enroll method to check if they are a member already, and if they are, print "User already a member." and return False, otherwise return True.
Add logic in the spend points method to be sure they have enough points to spend that amount and handle appropriately.
Create a file with the User class, including the __init__ with all the attributes, parameters and default values.

Add the display_info(self) method to the User class

In the outer scope, create a user instance and call the display_info method to test.

Add the enroll method to the User class, implement and test by calling the method on the user in the outer scope.

Make 2 more instances of the User class.

Implement the spend_points(self, amount) method

Have the first user spend 50 points

Have the second user enroll.

Have the second user spend 80 points

Call the display method on all the users.

BONUS: Implement the logic for testing if already a member and try to re-enroll the first user.

BONUS: Implement the logic to prevent over-spending and call the spend_points method with 40 points on the 3rd user.
